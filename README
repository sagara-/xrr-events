About:

xrr-events provides a way to run an executable whenever an output is added, removed, or modified (for example, when the resolution changes). It's meant to be run as a user-level daemon.

Usage:

`xrr-events --daemonize` will start the process and fork into the background. `xrr-events --help` will list all available options.
View the manpage for further details.
